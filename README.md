This is my capstone project for class 691.  Final course in Software Development.  I am building a website that allows me to enter places I have traveled to or places that I would like to go.  I will enter information about each place including cost and show a picture of the desired destination.  I will make it so other users can log in and add their own destinations.  Only a user that created a destination can edit the information created so you dont have to worry about another user altering or deleting something you created.
